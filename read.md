
As a fleet manager for Az National Trucking (ANT), a fictional national trucking corporation headquartered in California, 
we need to ensure that all the drivers in the fleet are in compliance with the rules and regulations of the corporation 
and do not present an insurance risk due to factors including speeding, unsafe following, lane departure, 
and other unsafe driving practices
